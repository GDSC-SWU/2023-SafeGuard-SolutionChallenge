In the industrial accident status announced by the Korean government in 2022, 644 people died, of which 53% was the highest rate in the case of accidents in the construction industry. As for the types of deaths in the construction industry, there were many accidents related to falls, such as death by falling, death by falling, and death by falling objects.

The number of migrant workers in the construction industry is also increasing every year, but industrial safety for them is not guaranteed. Migrant workers are more vulnerable to occupational safety than domestic workers, and are frequently exposed to dangerous industrial environments. Fall accidents may occur due to insufficient training on the work area, and there is a high possibility of getting caught or crushed without knowing the technical terms such as equipment and tools used in the construction site.

Safe Guard recognizes the reality of migrant workers in the construction industry and has created a service so that migrant workers can work safely by reducing the risk of accidents at construction sites and eliminating safety blind spots. You can check the types of accidents that can happen in the area, and help prevent actual accidents by providing a word book service related to equipment used at construction sites.

# 🦺 About SafeGuard


<b>Safe Guard is responsible for safety until the end</b><br>

Migrant workers working at construction sites can secure their own safety at the construction site through the Safe Guard. Through the app, you can learn and learn the language used in the construction site over and over again, and prevent accidents by informing you of the types of risks and how to cope with the places where users work. In addition, accidents at construction sites can be prevented through translations of documents necessary for labor contracts and the ability to report to 119 in the event of an accident.
