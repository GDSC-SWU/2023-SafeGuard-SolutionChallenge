# About SafeGuard
"Safe Guard" is responsible for safety until the end
Migrant workers working at construction sites can secure their own safety at the construction site through the Safe Guard. Through the app, you can learn and learn the language used in the construction site over and over again, and prevent accidents by informing you of the types of risks and how to cope with the places where users work. In addition, accidents at construction sites can be prevented through translations of documents necessary for labor contracts and the ability to report to 119 in the event of an accident.
